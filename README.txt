Assignment for the VUB course "Computer Algebra" by Prof. dr. Jan De Beule.

Executable files:
*jpeg_example.m
*image_decomposition.m
*quality_comparison.m
*frequency image.m

Other files are helper functions.

The testimage, couple.png, originates from the CSIQ database:
E.C. Larson and D.M. Chandler. "Most Apparent Distortion: Full-Reference Image Quality Assessment and the Role of Strategy". In: Journal of Electronic Imaging, 19 (1) (March 2010).

More efficient implementations are possible but the goal of this implementation is to be as understandable as possible, showing the inner workings of the JPEG standard.

NEW: A Julia implementation
